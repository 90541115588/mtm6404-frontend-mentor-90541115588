## My Process

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive navigation
- Custom JavaScript for navigation behavior

### What I Learned

This project helped me enhance my understanding of responsive design and dropdown navigation implementation. Below is a snippet of my HTML structure for handling responsive layout:

```html
<div class="hero-image col-md-5 text-center order-0 order-md-1">
  <img src="./images/image-hero-desktop.png" alt="Team collaboration illustration" class="img-fluid hero-image-size">
</div>
<div class="hero-text col-md-7 text-center text-md-start order-1 order-md-0">
  <h1 class="display-4"><b>Make remote work</b></h1>
</div>
```

The use of `order-0` and `order-md-1` allows me to swap the content order based on screen size.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue refining my responsive design skills and improve the use of custom dropdown navigation to make the interactions more seamless.

### Useful Resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) - Helped me set up a responsive navigation bar quickly.
- [MDN Flexbox Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Provided a deeper understanding of how to manage layout for responsive design.
